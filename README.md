# ML_Garbage_Classification

Class project for CSCI 635-2 group 7


## Downloading Project Data

To download the project data, run the following script in the project's _code_ directory:
```
download_data.py
```

The script requires no command line arguments to run. However, it does require the user to have a
kaggle.com username and up to date api key. These two items must also be registered on the machine's
user variables, as follows:

```
KAGGLE_USERNAME: <your kaggle.com username>
```
```
KAGGLE_KEY: <your api key>
```
The script will download the files necessary, unzip them and install them to the data directory, and
report on the results.
